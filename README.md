Lyricize is a web app designed for song writers to write better lyrics. 

The main feature is a helper tool that can generate random words or genres for inspiration, and has 14 stackable inputs to find rhymes, alliterations, similies, etc.

## Inspiration

Writing lyrics has always been really difficult, so I wanted to make a tool that could help people write better lyrics.

## Instructions

Users can search for song lyrics and save them to their favorites. Users can also write, view, edit, and delete their own written songs, and utilize a helper tool to find rhymes, similies, words that start or end with certain letters, etc. The inputs are stackable so users can narrow down their results as needed, and can click on any suggested word to see it's definition, synonyms, syllables, pronunciation, and more.
